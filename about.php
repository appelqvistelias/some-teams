        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello world! My name is Elias, and I am not very interested in football, or any sport for that matter. What I am interested in, however, is web development, which is why this site is built (apart from being an assigment that is). I would much rather play some video games or work out myself than watch sports. It is not unlikely that I'm missing out, but I do not think so. Anyway, I really hope this site is enjoyable for those who are interested in football.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello, world! My name is Elias, and I am not very interested in football, or any sport for that matter. What I am interested in, however, is web development, which is why this site was built (aside from it being an assignment). I would much rather play video games or work out myself than watch sports. While it’s possible that I’m missing out, I don’t think so. Anyway, I really hope this site is enjoyable for those who are interested in football.</p>
